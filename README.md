# Discord Permissions Calculator
A simple Python CLI interface for generating invite links for Discord bots.

# Usage

This script is very simple to use. You will need to have `Python 3` installed on the machine that you wish to run this script on, and you will also need to have downloaded `main.py`.

On most Linux distributions, you'll be able to run this script with:
```
python3 main.py
```
When in the directory that you have the script in.

On other operating systems, you should be able to import it into your IDE or use a similar method.

In order to use the script, you will need your bot's client ID. This can be found by right-clicking on your bot (on Discord) and then selecting *Copy Client ID*. This requires developer mode.

The next steps should be fairly simple, you just need to pick the permission level that you want to give the bot and the script will generate an invite link for you.

In most cases, you will not need to add a `custom scope`, a `redirect URI` or a `code grant`, so feel free to ignore these if you don't know what they are.
